# Review

^ Review wireframes and user flows, answer questions and give feedback.

---

## Look back at the work you have done so far and answer the following questions:

- Do you have a well-defined problem? Do you feel you are solving the right problem?

- Do you understand the user, their motives and needs? Is there an angle or a user you are missing?

---

## When going through your wireframes, ask yourself the following questions:

- Will this item appear on every page or just this page?

- How will this look on mobile devices?

- How do I go back to the previous page?

- How will this look on a larger display (1200px and up)?

- Will the user see a message to confirm their action?

# Grid/Spacing

![](architecture-art-background-236734.jpg)

^ Grid systems allow you to arrange content in a predictable, scalable way. Grids have a long, rich history in print design. In digital design, they provide guides for designers to create layouts that support different screen sizes.

^ Grids consist of equal sized columns separated by margins. Content can be placed in one or more of the columns.

^ Instructor: Open up Sketch and walk the class through the creation of artboards with different grid layouts.

# Typography

![](blur-classic-close-up-234133.jpg)

^ Typography can be an elusive and intimidating skill for the beginning designer. We look at type every day without understanding or fully realizing what goes into it. As with anything, it takes knowledge and practice.

---

# Why is good typography important?

^ Good typography allows you to make emotional connections with your audience, often on a subliminal level. It also determines how early your audience can access and assimilate the information being shown to them.

^ The typeface you choose affects the way the readers emotionally connect with the content.

^ The spacing between letters and lines of text can make your content easier or harder to read. The line length also impacts readability.

^ Kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, in order to make the text easier to read.

^ Tracking (Letter Spacing)
^ Tracking is different from kerning. Tracking adjusts the letter spacing uniformly over a range of characters. Adjusting tracking can also improve readability.

^ Leading is the old typographers term for the space between lines of text (vertically).

# Typeface

^ There are three types of typeface: serif, sans-serif, and decorative. Choosing typefaces can be overwhelming. Keep these rules in mind when choosing:

---

^ Decorative fonts are often creative and don't make for easy reading. They are best used for headlines or as accent text.

---

![fit](/Users/sarrahvesselov/Documents/ux-pt-course/wk-four-lesson-plan/Serif Fonts.png)

^ Serif fonts are considered more conservative and traditional. They give an air of seriousness and are thought to be slightly more difficult to read in digital form. In digital media, serif fonts are often used for headlines versus body text, but there are no hard rules.

![fit](/Users/sarrahvesselov/Documents/ux-pt-course/wk-four-lesson-plan/Sans-serif Fonts.png)

^ Sans-serif fonts are considered to be more modern than serif fonts.

^ Pairing complimentary fonts can make your content more comfortable to read. If you aren't sure how to pair fonts, tools like Font Pair will give you recommendations.

# Contrast

^ Contrasting type size, color, weight, and style can add impact and interest to your design. It can also support ideas and reinforce emotions.

---

## scale & hierarchy
## weight
## classification
## case
## color

^ You can create contrast in typography using scale, weight, classification, case, color

---

![fit](/Users/sarrahvesselov/Documents/ux-pt-course/wk-four-lesson-plan/newspaper.jpg)

^ Newspapers are experts at using contrast to bring readers through a page.

---

# Scale 

By setting a typographic scale, you can:

* control the pace at which a reader consumes content
* guide the reader through a page
* introduce hierarchy, helping the reader navigate and understand relationships between pieces of content.

^ Scale refers to the range of values at which type is sized. The more regular the intervals between each value, the more harmonious the scale.

---

## Hierarchy

^ Hierarchy is the arrangement of items in a way that some objects are perceived as being "above," "below," or "at the same level as" as other items. Hierarchy in typography is used to guide the reader through the content. Position and text size indicates what a reader should look at first, second, third, etc. It also makes your text more scannable.

# Consistency

^ Keep your use of text style, size, and color consistent. Do not use an excessive number of fonts and colors.

---

![fit](/Users/sarrahvesselov/Documents/ux-pt-course/wk-four-lesson-plan/Hierarchy with spacing color typeface.png)

^ Consistent fonts are especially important, as using too many can lead to a confusing and messy look. Even though only two font faces are used in this example, hierarchy is achieved by using size and color.

---

# Alignment

^ Keep your text aligned properly within the grid and with other items in your layout. Don't overuse center-alignment. Center-aligned text is appropriate for headlines and short spans of text. Centered paragraphs are harder to read and should be avoided.

---

^ Remember our grids? Use grids to align your text and space it out consistently.

---

# Whitespace

^ The spaces NOT taken up by text are as important as those with text. Whitespace is the area between and within design elements. It can be literal whitespace, colored, texture, or even have a background image. Whitespace is the biggest source of tension between designers and stakeholders.
